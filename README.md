# hashtagCoding
Hashtag coding is a hobby project site by stevenjchang. It is intended to have several subsections. Currently this project is focused on a subsection called Craigslist Manager.


# Craigslist Manager

### What does Craigslist Manager do?
- I'm currently looking for a ft job and a car, so this helps me. If you are too, then site can also help you.

The Craigslist Manager will allow users to browse the Jobs section, and Cars & Trucks section of Craigslist. As a user, I will be able to:

- Not be shown duplicate posts or posts that have been bumped
- Declutter my view, by having the ability to Hide any post 
- Have duplicate posts or reposts automatically hidden from me
- Make memos of posts, and have a record of the post even after it's been deleted on Craigslist
- Make "Applied" for Jobs and mark "Inquired" for Cars
- For Cars, be able to track average price of "Inquired" Cars based on model, price, year and mileage.
