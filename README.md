# hashtagCoding
Hashtag coding is a hobby project site by stevenjchang. It is intended to have several subsections.

## Craigslist Manager
- Currently this project is focused on a subsection called Craigslist Manager.

### What does Craigslist Manager do?

The Craigslist Manager will allow users to browse the Jobs section and Cars & Trucks section of Craigslist. As a user, I will be able to:

1) Not be shown duplicate posts or posts that have been bumped
2) Declutter my view, by having the ability to Hide any post (which will automatically hide any duplicates or reposts as well)
3) Make memos of posts, and have a record of the post even after it's been deleted on Craigslist
4) Make "Applied" for Jobs and mark "Inquired" for Cars
4) For Cars, be able to track average price of "Inquired" Cars based on model, price, year and mileage.
